# Guild Achieves

**Automatically congratulates your guildies on their achievements with hilarious, sarcastic messages!**

When a guild member earns an achievement, Guild Achieves waits 1-3 seconds (to seem human) and then sends a randomly selected funny congratulation to guild chat. With **800+ unique messages** across all achievement categories, your guild chat will never be boring again!

## FAQ

**Q: Will this spam guild chat?**
A: No! There's a configurable cooldown (default 5 seconds) between messages. If multiple guildies get achievements rapidly, only one message will be sent.

**Q: Can I turn off specific categories?**
A: Yes! Every category can be individually enabled/disabled in the settings.

**Q: Does this work for my own achievements?**
A: By default, no. But you can enable "Congratulate Yourself" in settings if you want!

**Q: Why the 1-3 second delay?**
A: So it doesn't look like an instant bot response! The randomized delay makes it feel more natural.
