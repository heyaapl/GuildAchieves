## FAQ

**Q: Will this spam guild chat?**
A: No! The smart batching system collects achievements for 3 seconds before responding. Multiple achievements from one player become one message. Raid achievements for 25 players become one celebration!

**Q: What if my raid kills a boss and everyone gets the achievement?**
A: You'll get ONE epic group celebration message instead of 25 individual spam messages!

**Q: Can I turn off specific categories?**
A: Yes! Every category can be individually enabled/disabled in the settings.

**Q: Does this work for my own achievements?**
A: By default, no. But you can enable "Congratulate Yourself" in settings if you want!

**Q: Why the 1-3 second delay?**
A: So it doesn't look like an instant bot response! The randomized delay makes it feel more natural.
