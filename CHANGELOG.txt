## Version 1.1.1 - Bug Fix

### 🐛 Fixed Self-Congratulation Bug
Fixed an issue where the addon would congratulate yourself when earning multiple achievements at once, even when "Congratulate Yourself" was disabled.

**Now fixed:**
- The `Congratulate Yourself` setting is properly respected in all scenarios:
  - Single achievements
  - Multiple achievements earned simultaneously
  - Group achievements (you're now filtered out of the player list when disabled)

## Version 1.1.0 - Smart Batching Update

### 🎯 Smart Achievement Batching
No more spam! The addon now intelligently batches achievements:
- **3-second collection window** - Gathers all achievements before responding
- **One player, multiple achievements?** - Combined into a single hilarious message
- **Raid boss kill?** - One celebration for the whole group instead of 25 spam messages!

### 🎉 Combo Messages - Multi-Achievement
When a single player earns multiple achievements at once (level up + dungeon + quest):
> "WHOA {player}! 3 achievements at ONCE?! Were you SAVING those up?! Show-off!"

**40 unique combo messages** for overachievers!

### 🏆 Group Celebration Messages
Different message pools based on group size:

| Group Size | Type | Example |
|------------|------|---------|
| 2-4 players | Small Group | "Squad goals ACHIEVED! LITERALLY!" |
| 5-9 players | Dungeon Party | "DUNGEON DOMINATION! The instance didn't stand a CHANCE!" |
| 10-19 players | Raid | "TEN-MAN TAKEOVER! COORDINATION LEVEL: EXPERT!" |
| 20+ players | Large Raid | "TWENTY-FIVE MAN DOMINATION! THE GUILD IS UNSTOPPABLE!" |

**110 unique group messages** across all sizes!

### 🧠 Smart Name Handling
- For groups of 5 or fewer: Lists all names ("Alice, Bob, and Charlie")
- For larger groups: "Player1, Player2, Player3, and 22 others"
- Automatic message truncation to fit WoW's 255 character limit
